Take calls on your website.

== Description ==
WP Phone is the “go to” system for managing calls that come into your website. Wp Phone allows you to get unique phone numbers for your website and then setup call flow systems using a simple drag and drop interface. You can set up automated voice response systems, capture and check voicemails, place calls,  setup phone menu system, filter out callers and much more.

WP Phone works by leveraging and integrating   <a href="http://www.ivrdesigner.com"> IVR Designer’s </a> system which allows users to build out call flow systems. You will need to register an account on www.ivrdesigner.com in order to use this plugin, you can register an account using the plugin or on their site directly.

* Business who want to use many phone numbers on their website.

= How do I use WP Phone? =
Simply Install the plugin, register an account and a business phone number and then customize your call flow.

= What does the default call system do? =
If you do not customize your call flow system at all it will work like this.
1. All calls placed from 9:00am-5:00pm that come into your WP phone number will then ring your personal phone number, if you don't pickup the calls will then be forwarded to a unique business phone voicemail system that only you have access to. 
2. Calls placed outside of 9-5 will be sent directly to a "we are closed please leave a voicemail message".
3. You can access that voicemail system by calling your WP Phone from your personal number.
4. You can place outbound calls by calling your WP phone number from your personal number and following the instructions.

= How do I get multiple phone numbers =
As of version 1.0 the plugin only supports 1 businesses phone number, but you can purchase additional phone number at www.ivrdesigner.com and use those on your website, however the shortcode for them will not work.

= How do I place outbound calls  =
By default if you call your business phone number from your personal number you will be presented with a voice menu that allows you to place outbound calls by inputing the number you would like to call.
